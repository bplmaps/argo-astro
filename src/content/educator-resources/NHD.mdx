## Finding the right map

When you search the ARGO website, you might not find your “perfect” map right away. Historians often have to try many different searches and look through a lot of things they don’t want until they find what they are looking for.

- **Drawing Inspiration**

  If you are still developing your project, browsing the ARGO website categories may be helpful. You can look through the maps by looking through Stories, Themes, and People. There is also a timeline on the homepage where you can browse by event.

- **Refining Your Search**

  If you know your project topic, here are some tips to use the search.

  - **Try multiple search terms.** Try to search by location, event, time period, and other terms you think might be helpful.
 
  - **Narrow broad search terms if you receive too many unrelated results.**
 
    - For example, if you search for “George Washington” you receive a variety of maps about the Revolutionary war battles, the development of Washington DC, and maps made in honor of President Washington. 

      Be specific about what moment in Washington’s life you are looking for information about by using a specific year, place, or battle.

## Using a map in your NHD Project

Our number one piece of advice? Take time to look. Just as you would read and reread any other primary source document, be sure to examine your selected map. You can look over the map with the following questions in mind:

- What does the map focus on?
  - How did the maker get you to focus? Did they use color? Are some things larger than others (scale)? What is at the center of the map? What features are accompanied by text?
- What is overlooked? What is unlabeled, at the edges, or missing altogether?
- How is the map intended to be used?
  - To show political boundaries? Navigation? Sharing data? Depicting a particular place for promotion or propaganda?

## Final Steps

- Cite
  - Be sure to include information about the map and where you found it.
- High quality image
  - Each digital entry includes multiple download sizes. Be sure you chose the right size for the way you will be using your map.
