Clements Library Collection", "abstract_tsi": "The Map Division of the Clements Library cares for an outstanding collection of printed and manuscript cartography. The focus of collecting is on maps of the Americas dating from European exploration and colonization to the early years of the twentieth century. The Map Division catalog includes about 30,000 maps and plans relating to the Americas. Approximately 2,500 of these are manuscript, and many of them came to the Library with large Revolutionary War and Early National period manuscript collections. They illustrate most of the important concerns for these periods of time. In addition to individual maps, the Clements has roughly 500 atlases dating from 1486 to the end of the nineteenth century.\n <br>\n <br>\n <a href=\"https://clements.umich.edu/explore-collections/maps/\" target=\"_blank\">https://clements.umich.edu/explore-collections/maps/</a>", "physical_location_ssim": ["William L.
