The AAS library today houses the largest and most accessible collection of books, pamphlets, broadsides, newspapers, periodicals, music, and graphic arts material printed through 1876 in what is now the United States, as well as manuscripts and a substantial collection of secondary texts, bibliographies, and digital resources and reference works related to all aspects of American history and culture before the twentieth century.<br/><br/>Of the approximately 10,000 maps in the AAS collection, 560 are dated 1750-1800, from which we selected approximately 140 items.&nbsp; Most of these are printed maps of eastern North America and the West Indies not duplicated in the Leventhal Map Center collection, as well as a smaller number of manuscript maps of local Massachusetts interest, all dated during the last half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.americanantiquarian.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.americanantiquarian.org/</a>", "physical_location_ssim": ["American Antiquarian Society"], "institution_name_ssi": "American Antiquarian Society", "institution_ark_id_ssi": "commonwealth:z603vf97w", "genre_basic_ssim": ["Collections", "Maps", "Manuscripts"], "_version_": 1778749516507250688, "timestamp": "2023-10-03T15:42:09.212Z"}
