Its extraordinary collections tell the story of America through millions of rare and unique documents, artifacts, and irreplaceable national treasures. As the nation&rsquo;s first historical society, the MHS strives to enhance the understanding of our nation&rsquo;s past and its connection to the present, demonstrating that history is not just a series of events that happened to individuals long ago but is integral to the fabric of our daily lives. Its collections are accessible to anyone with an interest in American history. Beyond research, the MHS offers many ways for the public to enjoy its collections including engaging programs, thought-provoking exhibitions, publications, seminars, and teacher workshops.<br/><br/>The holdings of the MHS include about 5,000 maps. Approximately 350 are dated in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries.
