Its mission is to collect, preserve, and share the significant history and culture of Kentucky and the Ohio Valley. The organization was named in honor of John Filson, Kentucky's first historian, whose book, \"The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of Kentucke\", and map of Kentucky were published in 1784. The maps included on ARGO are a part of the First American West digital exhibit, an online collection of letters, financial records, sermons, books, maps, and objects relating to the Ohio River Valley in the mid-1700s through the early 1800s, that was originally a collaboration with the Library of Congress and the University of Chicago.<br><br><a href=\"https://filsonhistorical.omeka.net/first-american-west\" target=\"_blank\">https://filsonhistorical.omeka.net/first-american-west</a>.", "physical_location_ssim": ["Filson Historical Society"], "institution_name_ssi": "Filson Historical Society", "institution_ark_id_ssi": "commonwealth:k643jt96c", "genre_basic_ssim": ["Collections", "Maps", "Books"], "_version_": 1832835073379926016, "timestamp": "2025-05-22T15:28:55.691Z"}
