In creating the Boston Athen&aelig;um, their purpose was to form &quot;an establishment similar to that of the Athen&aelig;um and Lyceum of Liverpool in Great Britain; combining the advantages of a public library [and] containing the great works of learning and science in all languages.&quot; The new Athen&aelig;um flourished in culture-starved Boston and, as it voraciously acquired books, art, and artifacts, it grew rapidly. For nearly half a century the Athen&aelig;um was the unchallenged center of intellectual life in Boston, and by 1851, had become one of the largest libraries in the United States. Today its collections comprise over half a million volumes, with particular strengths in Boston history, New England state and local history, biography, English and American literature, and the fine and decorative arts.<br/><br/>The Boston Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;s cartographic collection includes 3,000 maps and 600 atlases, but at the time of establishing this partnership only a small number had been digitized. Our selection of digital images includes two manuscript maps and 14 printed maps dating from 1750 to the first decade of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. These maps are not duplicated in the Leventhal Map Center&rsquo;s collection.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.bostonathenaeum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bostonathenaeum.org/</a>", "physical_location_ssim": ["Boston Athenaeum"], "institution_name_ssi": "Boston Athenaeum", "institution_ark_id_ssi": "commonwealth:4t64hr19t", "genre_basic_ssim": ["Collections", "Maps", "Manuscripts"], "_version_": 1778749516830212096, "timestamp": "2023-10-03T15:42:09.521Z"}
