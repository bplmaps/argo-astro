Rivers, county roads, bridges, courthouses, places of public worship, and distances of the town center to the county shire town and to Boston were to be included, drawn on a scale of 200 rods to the inch. Resolves 1795, May Sess, c 45 (June 24, 1795) repeated instructions and fines for those who had not yet submitted required plans. A map of Massachusetts proper and one of the District of Maine were compiled by Osgood Carleton from these plans and printed in 1802. The Massachusetts map is included in: Maps and plans ((M-Ar)50), no. 1616, 1617, 1617A and the map of Maine in no. 1618, 1618A. Three sets of these maps were sent to each of the states pursuant to Resolves 1794, c 77.", "physical_location_ssim": ["Massachusetts Archives"], "institution_name_ssi": "Massachusetts Archives", "institution_ark_id_ssi": "commonwealth:k35698213", "genre_basic_ssim": ["Collections", "Maps"], "_version_": 1778750429274832896, "timestamp": "2023-10-03T15:56:39.696Z"}
