Founded in 1804, The New York Historical is the oldest museum in New York City. The New York Historical has a mission to explore the richly layered political, cultural and social history of New York City and State and the nation, and to serve as a national forum for the discussion of issues surrounding the making and meaning of history. <br> <br> The New York Historical\u2019s library is one of the oldest and most distinguished in the United States containing millions of items within interrelated collections of books, pamphlets, maps, atlases, newspapers, broadsides, music sheets, manuscripts, prints, photographs and architectural drawings. It is one of only sixteen libraries in the United States qualified to be a member of the Independent Research Libraries Association. <br> <br> Digital images of approximately 25 maps, both printed and manuscript, from The New York Historical map holdings are included in this digital collection.
