Join Dr. Alexandra Montgomery to learn more about one of Early America’s most important cities, New York, from one of its most influential early maps: John Montrésor’s *A Plan of the City of New-York.* Washington owned a copy of this map, which was surveyed and drafted during the heady days of the stamp act riots and published at the beginning of the American Revolution.

Dr. Alexandra L. Montgomery is Manager of the Center for Digital History at the Washington Presidential Library at George Washington's Mount Vernon and one of the leads for the ARGO project. She holds a PhD in early American history from the University of Pennsylvania. When she is not wrangling digital projects about George Washington, her work focuses on land speculation, settler expansion, and mapping in eighteenth century North America.

This talk is part of the Brown Bag Lunch series hosted at the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon and was recorded June 7, 2024.
