The 1774 Quebec Act is primarily known for partially provoking the American Revolution. But it also formalized the continuation of French, and by extension, Indigenous land tenures in British-controlled Quebec. In this program, Julia Lewandoski explores how cartographers struggled to express and accommodate distinctive French and Indigenous forms of landholding on maps meant to assert British dominance over the province.

[Julia Lewandoski](https://history.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/lewandoski.html) is Assistant Professor of History at the University of California San Diego. She is a historian of Indigenous peoples, cartography, and empire in early North America. She is at work on her first book, *Land Tenure Survival: Imperial Law and Indigenous Creativity in the Treaty Era*, which explores Indigenous land ownership under successive imperial regimes in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Quebec, Louisiana, and southern California.

This talk is part of the [Richard H. Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) and was recorded September 10, 2024.
