Join scholar Kathleen DuVal as she takes us on a journey through geographies of the American Revolution that are often omitted from the popular imagination of this time period. Places like Lexington, Saratoga, and Yorktown are all famously associated with the Revolutionary period. But what about the sites where American Indians, Europeans, and Africans came into contact and conflict on the borderlands of North America?

Kathleen DuVal is the Bowman and Gordon Gray Distinguished Term Professor of History at the University of North Carolina and the author of numerous books and articles, including *Independence Lost: Lives on the Edge of the American Revolution* (Random House, 2015) and *The Native Ground: Indians and Colonists in the Heart of the Continent* (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006).

This talk is part of the [Richard H. Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) and was recorded October 26, 2021.
