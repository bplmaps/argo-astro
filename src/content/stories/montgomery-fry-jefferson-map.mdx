Join Dr. Alexandra Montgomery to learn more about the historic Fry-Jefferson Map of Virginia, which was once part of George Washington’s personal map collection. Created in 1753 by Thomas Jefferson’s father Peter, and Joshua Fry, it was considered the definitive map of Virginia in the eighteenth century.

Dr. Alexandra L. Montgomery is Manager of the Center for Digital History at the Washington Presidential Library at George Washington's Mount Vernon and one of the leads for the ARGO project. She holds a PhD in early American history from the University of Pennsylvania. When she is not wrangling digital projects about George Washington, her work focuses on land speculation, settler expansion, and mapping in eighteenth century North America.

This talk is part of the Brown Bag Lunch series hosted at the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon and was recorded October 10, 2023.
