The American Revolution is a profoundly place-based story. In 1775, war ignited in Boston and its surrounding towns, fueled by conflicts over trade, governance, and imperial authority.But what was it about Boston and Massachusetts in particular that made the region such a tinderbox for revolutionary activity in the late eighteenth century?

Drawing on maps in the ARGO collection, the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library presents _Terrains of Independence_, a free public exhibition at the Central Library. The exhibition is [on display from April 2025 through March 2026](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/), and features a companion digital exhibition in ARGO.
