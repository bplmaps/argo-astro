Join Dr. Alexandra Montgomery to learn more about George Washington’s relationship to the American west and one of the maps he used most frequently during the American Revolution: Thomas Hutchin’s 1778 *A New Map of the Western Parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina.* Washington used this map both during the war and after, when it informed his speculation in western lands and helped define how he understood the new nation he had helped create.

Dr. Alexandra L. Montgomery is Manager of the Center for Digital History at the Washington Presidential Library at George Washington's Mount Vernon and one of the leads for the ARGO project. She holds a PhD in early American history from the University of Pennsylvania. When she is not wrangling digital projects about George Washington, her work focuses on land speculation, settler expansion, and mapping in eighteenth century North America.

This talk is part of the Brown Bag Lunch series hosted at the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon and was recorded May 10, 2024.
