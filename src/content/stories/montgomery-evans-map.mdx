Join Dr. Alexandra Montgomery to learn more about one of George Washington’s favorite maps: Lewis Evans’ 1755 *A Map of the Middle British Colonies in North America.* The Evans map was one of the best maps of the Early American west and remained influential for decades in Anglo-American thought about what is now the Midwest.

Dr. Alexandra L. Montgomery is Manager of the Center for Digital History at the Washington Presidential Library at George Washington's Mount Vernon and one of the leads for the ARGO project. She holds a PhD in early American history from the University of Pennsylvania. When she is not wrangling digital projects about George Washington, her work focuses on land speculation, settler expansion, and mapping in eighteenth century North America.

This talk is part of the Brown Bag Lunch series hosted at the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon and was recorded November 1, 2023.
