*Disclaimer: There were some significant issues with the recorded audio for this presentation*

Join Dr. Alexandra Montgomery to learn more about one of the most influential maps of the eighteenth century: John Mitchell’s *A Map of the British and French Dominions in North America.* This map was used during the 1783 peace negotiations at the end of the American Revolution. It profoundly shaped how Washington’s generation understood the contours of North America.

Dr. Alexandra L. Montgomery is Manager of the Center for Digital History at the Washington Presidential Library at George Washington's Mount Vernon and one of the leads for the ARGO project. She holds a PhD in early American history from the University of Pennsylvania. When she is not wrangling digital projects about George Washington, her work focuses on land speculation, settler expansion, and mapping in eighteenth century North America.

This talk is part of the Brown Bag Lunch series hosted at the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon and was recorded December 18, 2023.
