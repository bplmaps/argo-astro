Join scholar John McCurdy as we learn about the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares to barracks and lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines the small-scale spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial conflict became personalized.

[John McCurdy](https://www.emich.edu/history-philosophy/history/faculty/j-mccurdy.php) is Professor and Graduate Coordinator in the Department of History and Philosophy at Eastern Michigan University. His publications include *Quarters: The Accommodation of the British Army and the Coming of the American Revolution* (Cornell University Press, 2019), *Citizen Bachelors: Manhood and the Creation of the United States* (Cornell University Press, 2009), and “From Fort George to the Fields: The Public Space and Military Geography of Revolutionary New York City,” (Journal of Urban History, 2018).

This talk is part of the [Richard H. Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) and was recorded April 26, 2022.
