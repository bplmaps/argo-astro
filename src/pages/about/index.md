**ARGO: American Revolutionary Geographies Online** is a new project led by the [Leventhal Map and Education Center](https://leventhalmap.org) at the Boston Public Library and the [George Washington Presidential Library](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/) at Mount Vernon. Leveraging new technology and the recent drive by many museums, libraries, and archives to digitize their collections, the portal collates digitized maps of North America made between 1750 and 1800 into a single user-friendly portal. In addition to providing users from many backgrounds with easy, intuitive access to beautiful high-resolution images, ARGO seeks to give users of all kinds the tools they need to learn and understand through interpretive essays, curated collections, classroom materials, and more. As a platform for scholarship, education, and exploration, the goal of ARGO is to make the rich visual legacy of our Revolutionary past accessible to the public as never before.

_ARGO_ is supported by a grant from the [National Historical Publications & Records Commission](https://www.archives.gov/nhprc) of the United States National Archives.
